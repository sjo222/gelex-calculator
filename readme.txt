A Simple Calculator
=======================


This is a simple calculator that reads commands line by line and performs integer calculations. A line can be an assignment, where a variable is assigned a value and declared at once, eg. "a=3". A line can also be an expression, whose calculated value is then printed to stdout. A line can also be blank. An expression can use the mathematical operators  +, -, //, *, and can parenthesize sub-expressions, and can contain literal integer values and variable names. Reading the .y and .l files would be the best guide to understanding how the calculator works.
